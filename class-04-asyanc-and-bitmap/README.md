## Overview
#### EventEmitter
* Much of the node APIs is built arount events
* All objects that emmit events in node are instances of the EventEmitter constructor
* EventEmitters are a great way to handle controling async events
* functions can be registered as listners for an event on instances of EventEmitters 
* instances of EventEmitters can emmit events and pass the listners data
* EventEmitters do not throw errors if events are emmited and have no listners to handle them
 * This can be a very powerful feature and is often used to implement "hooks" and "observables" in many librarys

``` javascript
'use strict';
// get access to EventEmitter constructor
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;

let storage = {};

// create an instance of the EventEmitter
let storageEmitter = module.exports = new EventEmitter();

// define a listener called setData
storageEmitter.on('setData', function(key, value){
  // beforeWrite and afterWrite listners have not been defined
  // but they could be implemented by a consumer of this storage 
  // module if they need  that functionality for any reason this 
  // is a super powerful reason people use EventEmitters
  storageEmitter.emit('beforeWrite', key, value);
  storage[key] = value; 
  storageEmitter.emit('afterWrite', key, value);
});

storageEmitter.on('getData', function(key ,callback){
  callback(storage[key]);
});

storageEmitter.on('deleteData', function(key){
  storageEmitter.emit('beforeDelete', key, storage[key]);
  let backup = storage[key];
  delete storage[key];
  storageEmitter.emit('afterDelete', key, backup);
});
```  

``` javascript
'use strict';

const storage = require('./storage.js');

// even though afterDelete wasnt implemented in the storage module
// we could implement it here to allow log the data being removed!
storage.on('beforeDelete', function(key){
  console.log('about to delete', key);
});

// even though afterDelete wasnt implemented in the storage module
// we could implement it here to allow us to delete all dependant data!
storage.on('afterDelete', function(key, value){
  // if the menu is delete then delete all of it items
  if(key === 'menu'){
    value.forEach( item => storage.emit('deleteData', item.name));
  }
});

let menu = [
  {
    name: 'blt',
    price: 8.45,
  },
  {
    name: 'pbj',
    price: 4.50,
  },
  {
    name: 'club',
    price: 9.00,
  },
  {
    name: 'veggy',
    price: 8.45,
  }
];

menu.forEach( item => storage.emit('setData', item.name, item));
storage.emit('setData', 'menu', menu);

storage.emit('getData', 'blt', function(data){
  console.log('blt', data);
})

storage.emit('deleteData', 'menu');

storage.emit('getData', 'blt', function(data){
  console.log('blt', data);
})

```  

#### Promise
* The Promise pattern allows us to chain asyncronous events
* When you create a new promise, you pass it two callbacks
 * the `resolve` callback is used on success
 * the `reject` callback is used on failure
``` javascript
function readFile(path){
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    fs.readFile(path, function(err, data){
      if (err) return reject(err);
      resolve(data);
    });
  });
}
```
* You can also create promises that explicity resolve or reject using convienece static methods
* `Promise.resolve(3)` - returns a promise that resolves the value three
* `Promise.reject(new Error('bad things'))` - returns a promise that rejects an `new Error('bad things')`
* `then` and `catch` methods are used to handle the result of a promise
* `then` and `catch` each take a callback as their argument
* `then` is called with the value that was `resolved(value)` in the last promise
* `catch` is called with the value that was `rejected(value` in the last promise
* Promises should only reslove or reject, not both
* In the callback of a `then` or a `catch` block if you return a value, it will be passed into the callback of the next then block
* In the callback of a `then` or a `catch` block if you return a Promise that rejects, the value you reject will be passed into the callback of the next catch block
``` javascript
Promise.resolve(3)
.catch(console.error) // will be skiped over because resolve allways goes to next then callback
.then(console.log)

Promise.reject('bad news')
.then(console.log) // will be skiped because reject allways goes to next catch callback
.catch(console.error)

Promise.reject('simple err msg')
.catch(err => {
  console.error( err);
  return 'hello world'; // this value will be resolved to the next then block :)
})
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error) // this will never be reached

Promise.resolve([2,3,4,5])
.then(nums => nums.map(num => num * 2))
.then(nums => Promise.reject('error for fun')) 
.then(console.log) // will never be reached
.catch(console.error)
```
##### readfile, ajax, writefile program 
* this program demonstrates the power of chaining async

  "https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:c"
]
```

``` javascript
'use strict';

const fs = require('fs');
const superagent = require('superagent');

// promises can be created using the new Promise() constructor
// which takes a callback that expects two callback functions resolve
// and reject.  
function readFileProm(path){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fs.readFile(path, (err, data) => {
      if (err) return reject(err); // reject is called anytime there is an error
      return resolve(data); // resolve is called when there is a success
    });
  });
}

function writeFileProm(path, data){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fs.writeFile(path, data, (err) => {
      if (err) return reject(err); // reject is called anytime there is an error
      return resolve(); // resolve is called when there is a success
    });
  });
}
// read a json file
// turn a buffer into a string
// parse the string into an array
// turn each url in the array into a GET request
// make all the requests
// extact the body from each response
// write the responses to the file system
// log success

readFileProm(`${__dirname}/gh-search.json`) 
.then(data => data.toString())  
.then(json => JSON.parse(json)) 
.then(urlList => { 
  let requests = urlList.map(url => superagent.get(url)); 
  return Promise.all(requests); 
})
.then(responses => responses.map(res => res.body)) 
.then(data => writeFileProm(`${__dirname}/results.json`, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2))) 
.then(() => console.log('success')) 
.catch(console.error)
```

#### Binary 
* you've probably heard that all things in the computer are just a bunch of zeros and ones
 * its true :)
* since zeros and ones mean almost nothing to humans we have created rules to convert them in to meaningful infromation
* Integers, floating point numbers, characters are some of the basic things we can turn zeros and ones into
* the process for taking an integer, float, character, or ect. and turning them into zeros and one is called encoding
* the process for taking zeros and ones and turning them into an integer, float, character, or ect. is called decoding
* binary and hex work a lot like decimal 
 * decimal is also called base 10
 * binary is also called base 2 
 * hex is also called base 16
 * if you take each digit multipy it times its base to the power of its place, you get its value
```

* to convert to floating points is a little takes the binary to decmial idea a little further by useing it for scientific notation
* to convert to text there is an encoding called ascii which maps all characters to a coresponding number
 * run the command `man ascii` in your command line to see an ascii chart
* now days we have a character encoding called `utf8` that is an extension for ascii, that suports multipul languages

#### Buffers
Pure javascript is Unicode freindly but not nice to bindary data. When dealing with TCP streams or the file system, it's necessary to deal with octet streams. node has a few ways to handle manipulating, consuming, and creating octet streams. 
Raw dat is stored as instances of the Buffer class A buffer is simular to an array of integers, but corresponds to raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap. a Buffer cannot be resized.

The Buffer class is a global, making it very rare that one would need to ever require('buffer').

* A Buffer represents ararys of bytes
 * A byte is made of of 8 bits
 * A bit is a single one or zero
* Each byte in a buffer can be decoded as an integer, floating point number, or a string
* Integers and Floats come in different sizes 8bit, 16bit, 32bit
* Strings come in different encodings 'hex', 'utf8', 'base64' ...
* Buffers are often referted to as raw data, meaning just a bunch of zeros and ones
* Many of the Node APIs use buffers as the data type when dealing with input and output
* Your OS stores binary in one of two ways
 * `little endian` - most significant bit first
 * `big endian` - least significant bit first
* In a node **REPL** you can un `os.endianness()` to determin how your os stores bytes
 * `'LE'` == little endian
 * `'BE'` == big endian
* Make sure your useing the methods that corresond to your systems **endianness**
 
###### Creating buffers
* ` new Buffer(size) ` allocates a new buffer of size octets(bytes)
* ` new Buffer(array) ` allocates a new buffer using an array of octets
* ` new Buffer(buffer) ` copys the passed buffer data onto a new Buffer instance
* ` new Buffer(str, *encoding) ` allocates a new buffer containing a givin string, Defaluts to utf8

###### buffer info
* ` Buffer.isBuffer(obj) ` test is obj is Buffer -> return boolean
* ` Buffer.isEncoding(encoding) ` test if the encoding is valid -> return boolean
* ` Buffer.byteLength(string, *encoding) ` gives the actual byte lenght of a string. Defalut encoding = utf8
* ` buf.length ` retrun the size of the buffer in bytes.

###### comparing buffers
* ` buf.equals(otherBuffer) ` returns boolean of weather this and otherbuffer have the same bytes
* ` buf.compare(otherbuffer) ` returns a bynber indicating wheather this comes before or after or is the same as the other buffer in a sort

###### copying, slice, and concat
* ` buf.copy( targetBuffer, *targetStart, *sourceStart, *sourceEnd)`
 * create a new buffer
* ` buf.slice(*start, *end) ` 
 * create a  a new buffer witch references the same memory as teh old by offset and cropped by start, end
* ` Buffer.concat(list, *totalLength) ` concatinates the buffers in the list

###### indexing a buffer
 * `buf[index]` get and set the octet at index (just like an array)
 
###### fill a buffer
* ` buff.fill(value, *offset, *end) ` fills the buffer with the specified value
 * **offset** - number of bytes into array, Defaults: 0
 * **end** - number of bytes into array to stop, Defaults, buffer.length
 
###### writing integers
* ` writeUInt16LE(value, offset, *noAssert)` 
* ` writeUInt32LE(value, offset, *noAssert)`
* ` writeUInt8(value, offset, *noAssert)`
* ` writeInt16LE(value, offset, *noAssert)`
* ` writeInt32LE(value, offset, *noAssert)`
* ` writeInt8(value, offset, *noAssert)`
 * **value** - Number to write
 * **offset** - number of bytes into array
 * **noAssert** - Boolean,  set to true to skip validation off offset

###### reading integers
* `readUInt16LE(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readUInt16BE(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readUInt32LE(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readUInt32BE(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readUInt8(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readInt16LE(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readInt16BE(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readInt32LE(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readInt32BE(offset, *noAssert)`
* `readInt8(offset, *noAssert)`
 * **offset** - number of bytes into array
 * **noAssert** - Boolean,  set to true to skip offset validation


###### writing strings
 * ``` buf.write(string, *offset, *length, *encoding)``` 
 * offset Defaluts to 0
 * encoding defalts to utf8
 * if buffer did not conain enough space to fit the entire string it will wrate a partial amount of the string. 
 * length defalts to buffer.length
 
###### reading stirngs
* ``` buf.toString(*encoding, *start, *end) ``` decodes and returns a string from buffer data
 * **encoding** - String, Defalut: 'utf8'
 * **start** - Number, Default: 0
 * **end** - Number, Default: buffer.length
 * Converting between buffers and strings requireds a specific encodeing 
  * `acii` - for 7 bit ASCII data
  * `utf8` - for multibyte encoded unicode characters
  * `utf16le` - 2 or 4 byte, little endian unicode
  * `ucs2` - alias of utf16le
  * `base64` - Base64 sring encoding
  * `hex` - encode each byte as two hexadecimal characters
